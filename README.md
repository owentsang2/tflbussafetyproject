# TfL Bus Safety Project

### Project Overview
This project aims to investigate the correlation between environmental factors and the safety of TfL bus operations. By analyzing historical weather data and bus accident records, we seek to identify potential contributing factors to accidents and injuries. This analysis aligns with TfL's Vision Zero goal of eliminating all deaths and serious injuries from London's transport network by 2041.

### Data Sources
TfL Bus Accident Data: This dataset provides detailed information on bus accidents, including date, time, location, and the number of injuries.
VisualCrossing Historical Weather Data: This dataset offers historical weather information for London, including temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and other relevant environmental factors.

### Tools and Methods
- Power BI: A powerful business intelligence tool used for data analysis, visualization, and reporting.
- Data Cleaning and Preparation: The datasets were cleaned, formatted, and prepared for analysis, including handling missing values and inconsistencies.
- Data Analysis and Visualization: Various data analysis techniques were employed to identify trends, correlations, and patterns. The results were visualized using charts, graphs, and dashboards to provide a clear understanding of the findings.

### Findings and Recommendations

#### Injury Forecast: 

The forecast suggests a potential decrease in bus injuries in the coming years, but it's important to continue monitoring trends and implementing proactive measures to maintain this downward trajectory.

#### Recommendations:
Continue implementing existing safety initiatives and explore new strategies to further reduce injuries. Utilize the injury forecast to inform resource allocation and prioritize safety interventions.

#### Correlation between Temperature and Accidents:
The analysis revealed a potential correlation between certain temperature ranges and an increased likelihood of bus accidents.
Seasonal variations were observed, with higher incident rates during specific months, particularly in the summer.

#### Recommendations: 
Implement targeted safety measures during peak accident seasons.
Provide seasonal training to drivers.
Consider infrastructure adaptations to mitigate the impact of high temperatures.

#### Additional considerations:
Continue monitoring accident trends over time.
Ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data.
Consider other factors that may influence accident rates.
By addressing these recommendations and conducting ongoing research, TfL can take a proactive approach to improving bus safety and reducing the number of accidents and injuries on London's roads.
